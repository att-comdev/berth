Add Dockerfile; update the container image we use to Ubuntu 16.04 with
a suitable KVM/Qemu.

Consider moving to stateful sets for cleaner PVC associations.  See
OSH MariaDB chart for an example of this.  One issue is that ss' will
remain after the fact; this may not always be desirable

One large mutable ConfigMap - not 2x per VM/POD

cloudinit vs cloud-config vs cloudconfig naming in various places

we have various types of 'names' when it comes to vms; some are used
in part for configmap names, some as hostnames, some for annotations;
it would be good to work out what the minimum required names are and
just implement those with cleaner semantics

instance_id sees misplaced and probably doesn't do what people think
it does, fix or remove it

yaml lint/validator tool; it's *really* easy to get the structure
wrong; ideally the tool should have basic knowledge of the cloud-init
stufs as well - because well, i hosed those more than once

annotations/checksums so that when a VMs parameters change it will be
restarted (in cases when it should); this might require updating the
VM definition structure to be clear on which parameters require a VM
restart

type_noimpl isn't well, implemented ... nuke for now
